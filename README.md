# Weather App 

### See current weather data for all the cities you want 

An assignment from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) to learn and practice:
- Asynchronous code 
- Manipulating JSON data
- Working with API's
- Promises
- Async/await
- State Management

### Things I learned:
- Error handling with Promises and Async/await
- Alerting users to errors made from an API call
- Converting data to useful units (e.g. wind speed from meters/second to km/hour)
- JavaScript life cycle 
- Using pseudo environment variables to store API keys (In config.js)
- Dynamically generating site data from multiple API calls

### Functionality:
- Add a city to see its current:
  - Temperature
  - A word describing the conditions
  - An icon depicting weather conditions
  - 'Feels Like' Temperature
  - Humidity
  - Rainfall for the current hour
  - Wind speed
- App alerts and prompts users if they have not entered:
  - Valid city name in the search bar
  - Any text (Which results in a 400 Bad Request HTTP error)
